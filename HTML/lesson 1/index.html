<h3>A few historical facts...</h3>


<p><b>Panic! at the Disco</b> is the solo project of American musician Brendon Urie. It was originally a pop rock band from Las 
Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2004 by childhood friends Brendon Urie, Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith and Brent Wilson. They recorded their
first demos while they were in high school. Shortly after, the band recorded and released their debut studio album, <i>A Fever
You Can't Sweat Out</i> (2005). Popularized by the second single, "I Write Sins Not Tragedies", the album was certified triple 
platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour and 
subsequently replaced by Jon Walker. The band's second album, <i>Pretty. Odd.</i> (2008), was preceded by the single "Nine in the 
Afternoon". That album marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut. Ross and Walker, who favored the 
band's new direction, departed because Urie and Smith wanted to make further changes to the band's style. Ross and Walker 
subsequently formed a new band, the Young Veins, leaving Urie and Smith as the sole remaining members of Panic! at the Disco.</p>

<p>Continuing as a duo, Urie and Smith released a new single, "New Perspective", for the movie Jennifer's Body, and recruited bassist 
Dallon Weekes and guitarist Ian Crawford as touring musicians for live performances. Weekes was later inducted into the band's lineup 
as a full-time member in 2010. The band's third studio album, <i>Vices & Virtues</i> (2011), was recorded solely by Urie and Smith in 2010, 
produced by John Feldmann and Butch Walker. Crawford departed once the tour cycle for Vices & Virtues ended in 2012.</p>

<p>As a three-piece, Urie, Smith, and Weekes recorded and released the band's fourth studio album, <i>Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!</i>, 
in 2013. Prior to the release of the album, Smith unofficially left the band due to health and drug-related issues, leaving Urie and 
Weekes as the remaining members. The duo recruited guitarist Kenneth Harris and drummer Dan Pawlovich as touring musicians for live 
performances.</p>

<p>In 2015, Smith officially left the band after not performing live with the band since his departure in 2013. Shortly thereafter, 
Weekes reverted to being a touring member once again, resulting in Panic! transitioning to a solo project presented by Urie. 
In April 2015, "Hallelujah" was released as the first single from Panic! at the Disco's fifth studio album, <i>Death of a Bachelor</i> 
(2016). In December 2017, Weekes officially announced his departure from the band. In March 2018, Panic! at the Disco released "Say Amen 
(Saturday Night)", the lead single from its sixth studio album, <i>Pray for the Wicked</i> (2018), which was released in June.</p>
